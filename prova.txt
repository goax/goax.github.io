This is some example source data for my nice little feed reader. I have designed my own nice little format which will allow it to include dynamic content. Who needs consultants when it's this easy? :) 

One of the best things is this will allow me to host my feed content to display on this page on an external server! So flexible :D

print("See? This is totally dynamic, generated by PHP right in my own little tool. Hacker proof, too, because there is a secret key required!");
